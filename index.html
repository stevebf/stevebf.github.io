    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>This app lets you see how much a university student in England or Wales is likely to have to repay on their student loan, and for how long. A student typically borrows their tuition fees and some living expenses. Interest is charged at RPI (Retail Price Index) + 3%, and repayments are automatically deducted from the student’s salary once they start earning, at a rate of 9% of everything they earn over £21,000. Any debt not paid off after 30 years is written off.</p>

<p>The app lets you play with these parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>The annual tuition fee charged by the university. Usually it’s £9000 per year.</li>
<li>What the student wants to borrow per year for living expenses. It’s capped according to household income.</li>
<li>How many years the course runs for. You can select 3, 4 or 5 years.</li>
<li>What annual salary the student might get when they graduate and start work.</li>
<li>An estimate of the rate at which the salary might increase per year.</li>
<li>Retail Price Index (RPI), an official government measure of inflation. It determines the rate at which the student is charged interest.</li>
</ul>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Amount borrowed: £38,463.00
Amount repaid: £63,574.06</p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4"></p>

<p>The student with the higher salary repays less in total, because they repay the debt more quickly.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>One interesting result that this app illustrates is that the repayment is a more dependent on the student’s salary than how much they borrow. Within certain parameters, a student repays the same amount over thirty years, even given considerable variation in the amount of debt.</p>

<p>Because interest is usually accruing faster that the student is paying it off, the debt will keep growing for many years, and most students will still be paying a large amount of their income towards paying off their student loan into their fifties.</p>

<p>This app will be useful in educating potential students about the commitment that they are about to enter into.</p>
